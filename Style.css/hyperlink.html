<p>Sky is blue Gases in the atmosphere like carbon dioxide, methane and water vapour trap some of the heat from the sun's rays, which would otherwise go back out into space. This keeps the Earth at a comfortable temperature, and prevents it getting too cold like a giant greenhouse.The sky is an unobstructed view upwards from the surface of the Earth . It includes the atmosphere and outer space. It may also be considered a place between the ground and outer space, thus distinct from outer space.There is a science behind the blue color of the sky. As we know our sun rays carry seven colors and these colors when they reach our atmosphere, they scatter. The color which scatters the most is Blue and Red color scatters the least. As a result, we see blue in most of the places especially the sky. </p>
